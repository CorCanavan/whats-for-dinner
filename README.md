## Introduction
What's for dinner? The ultimate question. This app helps users choose a recipe, whether it's for a side, main dish or dessert, as well as put together entire meals.

## Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- A user is able to select a dish option from the categories of: "Side", "Main Dish", or "Dessert", and then click the "Let's Cook!" button to populate a random dish from the list of possible dishes for that selected category.
- A user is able to select the dish option "Entire Meal" and click the "Let's Cook" button to populate an entire meal which includes a side, main and dessert option from the list of possible dishes for all categories.

## Possible Future Extensions
- Add functionality to the "Clear" button to allow users to clear a recipe after it has populated.
- Create functionality on the "Add a Recipe" button, which will display a form at the bottom of the page for the user to add in a new recipe of their choice.
- Create a "Favorite" button to appear when a recipe populates; add functionality for users to be able to save recipes to a separate saved recipes page.
- Users can then access these saved recipes by clicking on a "View Favorites" button that brings them to the saved recipes page.

## Lessons Learned
- There is SO MUCH that goes into bringing a page to life! This project was really illuminating when it came to what goes into all the moving pieces between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the importance of breaking it down by section. Writing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp is A LOT of trial and error! I learned the value of using Dev Tools to "test out" different CSS properties on HTML elements before actually applying them in the CSS file in order to get a better idea of which direction to go in to get elements to display the way I want.
